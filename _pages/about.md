Hi there! I'm currently a Master of Philosophy student researching new ways of characterising uncertainty in mathematical geophysical and climate models. See my [Research](/research) page for more details on the work I am doing.

My [blog](/blog) consists of various posts on interesting bits of maths and programming I come across and use.

I also provide a list of [talks](/talks) I have given over the years, from informal university seminars to conferences. I've included slides and links to any relevant code.
