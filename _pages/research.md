I am currently pursuing a Master of Philosophy (MPhil) in Applied Mathematics at [the University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/), under the wonderful supervision of [Associate Professor Sanjeeva Balasuriya](https://sanji-balasuriya.github.io/) and [Dr. John Maclean](https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/john.maclean).
My research is looking at devising practical and computationally efficient methods for characterising uncertainty in geophysical systems, such as the ocean, atmosphere, and climate.
Uncertainty can arise from many sources, including measurement error and unresolved process, and directly accounting for this can improve the predictions and forecasts of these models. 
I am combining stochastic processes, dynamical systems, and scientific computing (in [Julia](https://julialang.org/), because it's a cool and fast language) to understand how this uncertainty impacts predictions from a model, without having to resort to computationally expensive simulation.
