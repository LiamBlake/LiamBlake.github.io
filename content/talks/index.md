A collection of talks and seminars I've given. Some more formal than others. Slides are provided where available.

{{< talk "Lagrangian Coherent Structures" "Adelaide University Mathematics Postgraduate Seminar" "Adelaide, Australia" >}}
Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs) are regions in fluids that remain "coherent" in some sense as the flow evolves through time. Examples include jet streams, eddies, and flow barriers. These structures tell us about how drifters, pollutants, temperature, and energy are moved by the fluid. LCSs have even been used to understand the mechanisms in blood flow that cause heart problems and to explain how jellyfish capture prey. In this talk, I will briefly introduce LCSs and discuss one of the most popular methods for extracting coherent structures; the finite-time Lyapunov exponent.

{{< talk "A computable characterisation of model uncertainty" "ANZIAM 2023" "6th Feb 2023" "Cairns, Australia" >}}
Deterministic continuous-time dynamical systems are vital for prediction in many areas, such as understanding geophysical, biological, and socio-economic phenomena. However, uncertainty in such models is unavoidable, arising from observation and discretisation error and other unexplained phenomena. This uncertainty can be accounted for by introducing stochastic components into the deterministic model, but this is both analytically and computationally difficult. This talk will present a multivariate Gaussian distribution characterising stochastic error in solutions to a best-available deterministic model, by considering an It√¥ stochastic differential equation formulation. The distribution captures the intrinsic uncertainty in the model, due to both the model dynamics and any specified spatiotemporal dependency in the noise and is rigorously justified as a small-noise limit. By specifying the Gaussian distribution entirely in terms of the solution dynamics of the deterministic model, uncertainties can be ascribed to any such model given only solution data. The computability also means that it can serve as an approximation of the stochastic solutions with small noise, circumventing the need for expensive Monte-Carlo simulations. This practical framework has many applications across, for example, oceanography and atmospheric modelling, data assimilation and Lagrangian coherent structure extraction.
